        #   either with:
        #   - The Function Code (a criticial software bug).
        #   - The Executor machine/container/VM (a software bug or malfunctioning local hardware).
        # * Critical Function Code bugs tend to get fixed eventually by users. What doesn't get fixed eventually
        #   is rare but recurring local Executor issues like hardware errors and software bugs in middleware like
        #   drivers.
        # * Such issues tend to get mitigated by automatically recreating the Executor machine/VM/container.
        # * So we fail whole Executor health check if a Function Executor health check ever failed to hint the users
        #   that we probably need to recreate the Executor machine/VM/container (unless there's a bug in Function
        #   code that user can investigate themself).
