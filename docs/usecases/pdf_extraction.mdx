This guide will walk you through using Indexify for PDF extraction, from basic concepts to advanced use cases. Although this guide doesn't make any assumptions about your familiarity with Indexify or its components, we highly recommend you go through the [Getting Started](https://docs.getindexify.ai/docs/getting-started-basic/) and [Key Concepts](https://docs.getindexify.ai/concepts/) guide.

## Getting Started for PDF Extraction

### Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.11 or older installed (Indexify currently requires this version)
- Basic familiarity with Python programming
- An OpenAI API key (for using GPT models in the question-answering part)
- Command-line interface experience

### Setup

You'll need three separate terminal windows open for this tutorial:

1. Terminal 1: For downloading and running the Indexify Server
2. Terminal 2: For running Indexify extractors
3. Terminal 3: For running Python scripts to load and query data from the Indexify server

We'll use the following notation to indicate which terminal to use:

```bash ( Terminal X ) Description of Command
<command goes here>
```

## Understanding PDF Extraction

PDF extraction is the process of pulling out useful information from PDF files. This can include:

- **Text**: The main content of the document.
- **Images**: Any pictures or graphics in the PDF.
- **Tables**: Structured data presented in a tabular format.
- **Metadata**: Information about the document itself, such as author, creation date, etc.

Extracting this information can be challenging due to the complex structure of PDF files. Indexify simplifies this process by providing specialized extractors for each type of content.

## Indexify PDF Extractors

Indexify offers several extractors specifically designed for PDF documents. Here's an overview of the main ones:

| Extractor Class Name | Features | Best Use Case |
|----------------------|----------|---------------|
| tensorlake/pdfextractor | Extracts text, images, and tables | Best for scientific papers with tabular information |
| tensorlake/easyocr | Focuses on text extraction | Optimized for photocopied or scanned PDFs (GPU-based) |
| tensorlake/marker | Converts PDFs to Markdown | Best for detailed, structured, and formatted PDFs |

Let's visualize how these extractors fit into an extraction pipeline:

![extractor_types](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98d4a8f2-07dd-46db-ba1d-d1a24e58aaa1)

This diagram shows how different Indexify extractors can process a PDF document, each producing specific types of output. To learn more about various types of extractors or the guide to creating your own extractor, read the official docs [here](https://docs.getindexify.ai/apis/extractors/#extractor-input-and-output).

## End-to-End Example: Building a PDF Knowledge Base

Let's walk through a complete example of how to use Indexify to build a PDF knowledge base. This example will demonstrate how to extract text, images, and tables from a set of PDF documents and store the extracted information for later use. The PDF we will be using for this example is the technical report for Mistral, found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.06825.pdf).

def get_tables(pdf_path):
    client = IndexifyClient()
    
    # Upload the PDF file
    content_id = client.upload_file("table_extractor", pdf_path)
    
    # Wait for the extraction to complete
    client.wait_for_extraction(content_id)
    
    # Retrieve the tables content
    tables = client.get_extracted_content(
        ingested_content_id=content_id,
        graph_name="table_extractor",
        policy_name="pdf_to_table"
    )
    
    return tables[0].features[0].value if tables else None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pdf_url = "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.06825.pdf"
    pdf_path = "reference_document.pdf"
    
    # Download the PDF
    download_pdf(pdf_url, pdf_path)
    
    # Get tables from the PDF
    tables = get_tables(pdf_path)
    print("Tables from the PDF:")
    print(tables)
```

Run the script:

```bash ( Terminal 3 ) Run Table Extraction
python3 table_extraction.py
```
Following is the output of the extraction process. 

| Sample Page to extract table from | Sample Extracted Table |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------|
| <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tensorlakeai/indexify/main/examples/pdf/image/2310.06825v1_page-0004.jpg" width="600"/> | ```{"0": ["Model", "Modality", "MMLU"], "1": ["LLaMA 2 7B", "Pretrained", "44.4"], "2": ["Code-Llama 7B", "Finetuned", "36.99"]}``` |

### Text Extraction

For simple text extraction, follow these steps:

1. Create a file named `content_extraction.py` with the following content:

```python continuous_extraction.py
from indexify import IndexifyClient, ExtractionGraph
import requests

client = IndexifyClient()

extraction_graph_spec = """
name: 'pdfknowledgebase'
extraction_policies:
   - extractor: 'tensorlake/pdfextractor'
     name: 'pdf_to_text'
"""

extraction_graph = ExtractionGraph.from_yaml(extraction_graph_spec)
client.create_extraction_graph(extraction_graph)

def process_pdf(url):
    # Download the PDF
    response = requests.get(url)
    pdf_content = response.content
    filename = url.split("/")[-1]

    # Upload and process the PDF
    content_id = client.upload_bytes("pdfknowledgebase", pdf_content, filename)
    
    # Wait for the extraction to complete
    client.wait_for_extraction(content_id)
    
    # Retrieve and print extracted content
    extracted_content = client.get_extracted_content(
        ingested_content_id=content_id,
        graph_name="pdfknowledgebase",
        policy_name="pdf_to_text"
    )
    print(f"Extracted content from {filename}:")
    print(extracted_content)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pdf_url = "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.06825.pdf"
    process_pdf(pdf_url)
```

4. Run the continuous extraction script:

```bash ( Terminal 3 ) Run Content Extraction
python3 content_extraction.py
```
Following is the output of the extraction process. 

| Sample Page to extract content from | Sample Extracted Content |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tensorlakeai/indexify/main/examples/pdf/image/2310.06825v1_page-0004.jpg" width="600"/> | ```Size and Efficiency. We computed "equivalent model sizes" of the Llama 2 family, aiming to understand Mistral 7B models...``` |

This guide demonstrates how to use Indexify for PDF extraction, closely aligning with the provided examples. Key points:

1. Separate scripts for image extraction, table extraction, and continuous extraction.
2. PDFs are downloaded from URLs instead of using local file paths.
3. Extraction graphs are set up for each specific task.
4. The extraction scrips can be extended to process multiple PDFs in sequence.

You can further extend these scripts to include additional processing steps or to handle multiple PDFs as needed for your specific use case.

### Visualize the Extraction Process

Let's visualize our PDF knowledge base extraction process:

![extractor_flow](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31da97c4-f81f-4388-bfe8-ec7c0a962bd6)

This diagram illustrates how PDF documents are processed through Indexify, extracted using the `tensorlake/pdfextractor`, and stored in a knowledge base for later querying and retrieval.

## Advanced Use Cases

Once you have extracted content from your PDFs, you can use it for various advanced applications:

1. **Document Search Engine**: Index the extracted text to create a searchable database of your PDFs.
2. **Image Analysis**: Process extracted images for tasks like object detection or classification.
3. **Data Analysis**: Use extracted tables for data analysis and visualization.
4. **Question Answering**: Combine extracted content with language models for automated question answering.

Here's a simple example of how you might use the extracted text for a basic search functionality:

```python
from indexify import IndexifyClient
from rapidfuzz import fuzz

client = IndexifyClient()

def search_pdfs(query, graph_name="pdf_knowledge_base", policy_name="pdf_extractor"):
    results = []
    for content_id in client.list_content_ids(graph_name):
        extracted_content = client.get_extracted_content(
            ingested_content_id=content_id, 
            graph_name=graph_name, 
            policy_name=policy_name
        )
        for content in extracted_content:
            if content.content_type == "text/plain":
                text = content.data.decode('utf-8')
                similarity = fuzz.partial_ratio(query.lower(), text.lower())
                if similarity > 70:  # Adjust this threshold as needed
                    results.append((content_id, similarity))
    
    return sorted(results, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

# Example usage
search_results = search_pdfs("machine learning")
for content_id, similarity in search_results[:5]:  # Top 5 results
    print(f"Content ID: {content_id}, Similarity: {similarity}")
```

This script implements a simple fuzzy search across all extracted text from your PDFs, returning the most relevant documents based on the search query.


## Extractor Performance Analysis

When choosing an extractor for your PDF processing needs, it's important to consider both accuracy and speed. Here's a comparison of the performance of different Indexify PDF extractors:

### Scoring Methodology

The scoring was done by comparing the extracted text from each PDF with its reference text using the following steps:

1. **Chunking**: Both the hypothesis (extracted text) and the reference text are divided into chunks of 500 characters, ensuring chunks have a minimum of 25 characters.
2. **Overlap Score Calculation**: For each chunk of the hypothesis text, a fuzzy matching score with the best-matching reference chunk within a defined range is computed using the `rapidfuzz` library. This range is determined based on a length modifier and search distance.
3. **Final Score**: The average of these chunk scores provides a final alignment score between 0 and 1, indicating how closely the extracted text matches the reference.

### Extractor Performance

| Extractor                   | Accuracy | Speed | Best For                            |
|-----------------------------|----------|-------|-------------------------------------|
| tensorlake/pdfextractor     | High     | Fast  | General-purpose extraction          |
| tensorlake/easyocr          | High     | Slow  | Scanned documents (GPU-based)       |
| tensorlake/marker           | Very High| Slow  | Detailed, structured PDFs           |
| layoutlm-document-qa        | High     | Medium| Question-answering tasks            |
