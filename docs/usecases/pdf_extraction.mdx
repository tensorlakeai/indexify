title: 'PDF Extraction'
---
PDF is a widely used file format for sharing documents. Often, Enterprise LLM applications need to derive information that are locked
inside PDF documents.
You can build workflows with Indexify that uses any PDF Extraction Model to extract tables, images and text from PDFs. 

You can use many different PDF models or APIs within a single workflow. Dynamic routing can be used to route the PDF to different 
models based on the document layout.
