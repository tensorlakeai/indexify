title: Quick Start
---

Let's create a simple workflow to summarize a website on-demand! It demonstrates how to build and serve a workflow as a **remote** Python API.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install">
    Install the Indexify SDK.
    ```bash
    pip install indexify
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define the Graph">
    We will write two functions, `scrape_website` and `summarize_text`.
    We create a Graph `website-summarizer` that executes the scrape function, and then executes the summarizer with the outputs of the scraper.

    ```python
    from indexify import indexify_function, Graph

    @indexify_function()
    def scrape_website(url: str) -> str:
        import requests
        return requests.get(f"http://r.jina.ai/{url}").text

    @indexify_function()
    def summarize_text(text: str) -> str:
        from openai import OpenAI
        completion = OpenAI().chat.completiions.create(
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant. Generate a summary of this website"},
                {"role": "user", "content": text},
            ],
        )
        return completion.choices[0].message.content

    g = Graph(name="website-summarizer", start_node=scrape_website)
    g.add_edge(scrape_website, summarize_text)
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the Graph In-Process">
    The graph can be run as-is, this is useful for testing.

    ```python
    g.run(url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors")
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploying a Graph as an Remote API">
    When it's time to consume your graph from other applications, you can serve it as an API. You can run the server in production in many ways, but here we run this in our laptop to show how it works.

    ```bash
    indexify-cli server-dev-mode
    ```

    This starts the following processes -
    * **Server:** Orchestrates functions in the graph, stores execution state, and hosts Remote Graph APIs.
    * **Executor:** Runs the individual functions in the graph.

    Once the server is ready, you can deploy the graph -
    ```python
    from indexify import RemoteGraph
    RemoteGraph.deploy(g, server_url="http://localhost:8900")
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Call a Graph Endpoint">
    Once the graph is deployed, you can get a reference of the Graph in any application.
    ```python
    graph = RemoteGraph.by_name(name="website-summarizer", server_url="http://localhost:8900")
    ```

    You can now call the graph as a remote API.
    ```python
    invocation_id = graph.run(blocking_until_done=True, url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors")
    results = graph.output(invocation_id)
    ```
