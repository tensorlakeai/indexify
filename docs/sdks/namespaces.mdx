Namespaces are used to isolate content uploaded by applications.

<Note>
  A default namespace, named `default` is created when Indexify is started.

## Create a Namespace
A namespace can be created by specifying a unique name, and any additional labels or extraction policies.

```python Python
from indexify import IndexifyClient

IndexifyClient.create_namespace(
    name="research",
)
```
