There are two CLIs for Indexify - 
* Server CLI - Starts server for hosting Graph Endpoints and Orchestration.
* Executor CLI - Starts Executors that run functions, and build docker images with dependencies for running them.


## Server
The server can be downloaded from the Indexify website

```bash
curl https://www.tensorlake.ai | sh
```

### Start Server 
Start the server in the current directory

```bash
indexify-server
```

### Start with Custom Config

```bash
indexify-server -c /path/to/config.yaml
```

## Start Executor 

The executor cli is packaged in the `indexify` python package.

Install the package using pip -
```bash
pip install indexify
``` 

### Start Executor

```bash
indexify-cli executor --server-addr <server-ip>:<server-port>
```

Starts an executor and connects to the server at the given address. The server address can be found from the Indexify server's configuration.

**Default Server Address:** `localhost:8900`

## Start Server and Executor in Dev Mode 

The `indexify-cli` can download the server and executor and start them in the same terminal for convenience.

```bash
indexify-cli server-dev-mode
```

## Build Function Images

```bash
indexify-cli build-image /path/to/workflow/file.py function_name
```

The file name is the path to the file that contains the function for which the image has to be built.

## Build Default Image

This is rarely needed but can be used to build the default image that is used by the executor to run functions.

```bash
indexify-cli build-default-image
```
