Indexify offers a built-in user interface (UI) that simplifies debugging and content visualization. This UI works seamlessly with Indexify's APIs and consists of three main sections:

1. Compute Graphs
2. Namespaces
3. Executors

To access the UI after running Indexify locally, visit: http://localhost:8900/ui

## Compute Graphs

The home page displays all Compute Graphs within your namespaces (default name is "default").

Click on any Compute Graph to view its detailed information, including:
- Creation time
- Edges
- Nodes
- Description
- Other relevant details

### Invocations

Below the Compute Graph definitions, you'll find all associated Invocation IDs. This section shows:
- Invocation IDs
- Payload sizes
- Option to delete an Invocation (via the Delete Icon)

Clicking an Invocation ID reveals two key features:

#### Invocation Outputs

This section displays:
- Outputs for the selected Invocation ID
- Associated Compute Functions
- Log access via "View stdout" and "View stderr" buttons
- Search functionality for outputs
- Collapsible Compute Function tables for better visibility

#### Invocation Tasks

Below the Outputs, you'll see the Tasks that ran for your Invocation, including:
- Task ID
- Compute Function
- Input Key
- Task Outcome
- Search functionality for tasks by ID

## Executors

The Executors section shows all executors connected to Indexify, displaying:
- Executor name
- Executor ID
