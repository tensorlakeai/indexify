## üåü What Can You Achieve with Indexify?

With Indexify, you can accomplish remarkable feats with your PDFs:

1. üîç **Data Extraction:** Easily extract specific information from PDFs, such as fields from tax documents, healthcare records, invoices, and receipts. Say goodbye to manual data entry and hello to automated efficiency!
2. üìö **Document Indexing:** Build comprehensive indexes on vector stores and structured stores by combining PDF extractors with chunking, embedding, and structured data extractors. Create a searchable knowledge base that's always at your fingertips!
3. ü§ñ **Document Q&A:** Leverage the power of LLMs to query your document indexes and get accurate answers to your questions. It's like having a personal assistant that knows your documents inside out!

## üîß The Extraction Pipeline: A Three-Stage Journey

To unlock the full potential of your PDFs, we've designed a seamless three-stage extraction pipeline that will take you from raw documents to actionable insights:

1. üìÑ **Content Extraction Stage:** Start by extracting raw content from your PDFs using extractors like `pdf/pdf-extractor` or `pdf/markdown`. These extractors will retrieve text, images, and tables from your documents, laying the foundation for further analysis.
2. ‚úÇÔ∏è **Content to Chunk Extraction Stage:** Break down the extracted content into manageable chunks using extractors like `text/chunking`. This stage helps organize your content into coherent and contextually relevant pieces, making it easier to process and understand.
3. üß† **Chunk to Embedding Extraction Stage:** Convert the chunks into vector embeddings using extractors like `embedding/minilm-l6` or `embedding/arctic`. By transforming your content into numerical representations, you enable powerful similarity search and retrieval capabilities.

By chaining these stages together, you can create a powerful pipeline that enables question answering using the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approach. Watch as your documents come to life, ready to answer any question you throw at them! üöÄ

## üöÄ Get Started with PDF Extraction

Ready to dive in and experience the magic of PDF extraction? Here's how you can test it locally and unlock the secrets hidden within your documents:

1. Download a PDF Extractor:
   ```bash
   indexify-extractor download hub://pdf/pdf-extractor
   indexify-extractor join-server pdf-extractor.pdf_extractor:PDFExtractor
   ```

2. Load it in a notebook or terminal:
   ```python
   from indexify_extractor_sdk import load_extractor, Content
   extractor, config_cls = load_extractor("pdf-extractor.pdf_extractor:PDFExtractor")
   content = Content.from_file("/path/to/file.pdf")
   results =  extractor.extract(content)
   print(results)
   ```

Watch as the extractor works its magic, revealing the hidden gems within your PDFs. It's like having a superhero sidekick that can read and understand your documents in the blink of an eye! ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüìÑ

   from indexify import IndexifyClient
   client = IndexifyClient()
   content_id = client.upload_file("/path/to/pdf.file")
   ```

5. Inspect the extracted content:
   ```python
   extracted_content = client.get_extracted_content(content_id=content_id)
   print(extracted_content)
   ```

With just a few lines of code, you can unleash the full potential of PDF extraction in your applications. Imagine the possibilities: automated data entry, intelligent document search, and effortless question answering. The sky's the limit! üöÄüåü
