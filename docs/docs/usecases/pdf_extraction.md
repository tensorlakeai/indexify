# PDF Extraction

Indexify provides extractors that extract text, images, and tables from PDF documents. Some extractors also convert PDFs to markdown documents. You can build complex pipelines that can extract and write tabular information from PDF documents in structured stores or extract embedding from texts in the documents. PDF is a complex document type; we offer many different extractors suitable to various use cases.

## What Can You Achieve with Indexify?

With Indexify, you can accomplish the following with your PDFs:

1. üîç **Data Extraction:** Easily extract specific information from PDFs, such as fields from tax documents, healthcare records, invoices, and receipts. Use Cases: Automate Manual Data Entry
2. üìö **Document Indexing:** Build searchable indexes on vector stores and structured stores by combining PDF extractors with chunking, embedding, and structured data extractors. Use Cases: RAG Applications, Assistants, etc.
3. ü§ñ **Document Q&A:** Get Answers to specific Questions from Documents without creating indexing. 

## The Extraction Pipeline: A Three-Stage Process

PDF Extraction Pipelines are usually composed of three stages. You can use one or more of these stages depending on your use case - 

1. **Content Extraction Stage:** Start by extracting raw content from your PDFs using extractors like `pdf/pdfextractor` or `pdf/markdown`. These extractors will retrieve text, images, and tables from your documents.
If all you want is to extract text, images, and tables from a PDF, this is the only stage you need in an extraction graph. The following stages allow for further transformations, or extraction of derived information from a PDF document.

2. **Content to Chunk Extraction Stage:** Break down the extracted content into manageable chunks using extractors like `text/chunking`. This stage helps organize your content into coherent and contextually relevant pieces, making it easier to process and understand.
3. **Chunk to Embedding Extraction Stage:** Convert the chunks into vector embeddings using extractors like `embedding/minilm-l6` or `embedding/arctic`. 

## Image Extraction
If you would like to extract images from PDF, the best extractor to use is `tensorlake/pdfextractor` It automatically extracts images from documents and writes them into blob stores. Once images are extracted, you could create pipelines for many downstream image tasks - Embedding using CLIP for semantic search, visual understanding of images using GPT4V, Cog or Moondream, or object detection using YOLO.Indexify provides extractors for all these downstream tasks.

You can get extracted images from pdfextractor with a simple python code like this:
```python
content_id = client.upload_file("extraction_graph_name", "file.pdf")
```
```python
def get_image_content(client, content_id):
    extracted_content = client.get_extracted_content(content_id)
    
    for item in extracted_content:
        child_id = item['id']
        
        structured_data = client.get_structured_data(child_id)
        
        for data in structured_data:
            if 'metadata' in data and data['metadata'].get('type') == 'image':
                return item['content']
    
    return None
```

## Table Extraction
Tables are automatically extracted by `tensorlake/pdfextractor` as JSON metadata. You can query the metadata associated with documents by calling the Retrieval APIs. 

You can get extracted tables from pdfextractor with a simple python code like this:
```python
content_id = client.upload_file("extraction_graph_name", "file.pdf")
```
```python
def get_table_content(client, content_id):
    extracted_content = client.get_extracted_content(content_id)
    
    for item in extracted_content:
        child_id = item['id']
        
        structured_data = client.get_structured_data(child_id)
        
        for data in structured_data:
            if 'metadata' in data and data['metadata'].get('type') == 'table':
                return item['content']
    
    return None
```

#### Time Taken Comparison Graph

![](benchmark/time.png)

### Detailed Analysis and Insights

1. **Accuracy**: 
   - Overall, the Marker extractor consistently provides high accuracy scores across all PDF documents.
   - The Unstructured IO extractor also performs well, often close to the accuracy of the Marker extractor.
   - The PDF Extractor delivers reliable accuracy, with scores that are generally competitive with the other extractors.

2. **Time Efficiency**:
   - The Unstructured IO extractor is the fastest, taking the least time for all PDF documents.
   - The PDF Extractor is moderately fast, providing a good balance between speed and accuracy.
   - The Marker extractor, despite providing high accuracy, is significantly slower compared to the other two extractors.

3. **Extractor Recommendations**:
   - **Marker Extractor**: Use when accuracy is the primary concern and processing time is less critical. Ideal for scenarios requiring detailed and precise text extraction.
   - **PDF Extractor**: Use for a balanced approach where both accuracy and speed are important. Suitable for applications needing quick results without compromising much on accuracy.
   - **Unstructured IO Extractor**: Use when speed is the primary concern. Perfect for real-time applications or scenarios where quick extraction is essential.

### Conclusion

The choice of extractor depends on the specific requirements of the task at hand. If high accuracy is crucial and time is less of an issue, the Marker extractor is the best choice. For a balance of accuracy and speed, the PDF Extractor is suitable. For scenarios where speed is critical, the Unstructured IO extractor is the optimal choice.

By considering these factors, you can select the most appropriate extractor for your specific use case, ensuring efficient and effective PDF text extraction.

### Scoring Methodology

The scoring was done by comparing the extracted text from each PDF with its reference text using the following steps:

1. **Chunking**: Both the hypothesis (extracted text) and the reference text are divided into chunks of 500 characters, ensuring chunks have a minimum of 25 characters.
2. **Overlap Score Calculation**: For each chunk of the hypothesis text, a fuzzy matching score with the best-matching reference chunk within a defined range is computed using the `rapidfuzz` library. This range is determined based on a length modifier and search distance.
3. **Final Score**: The average of these chunk scores provides a final alignment score between 0 and 1, indicating how closely the extracted text matches the reference.

## Get Started with PDF Extraction

You can test it locally:

1. Download a PDF Extractor:
   ```bash
   indexify-extractor download tensorlake/pdfextractor
   indexify-extractor join-server
   ```

2. Load it in a notebook or in a Python script:
   ```python
   from indexify_extractor_sdk import load_extractor, Content

   extractor, config_cls = load_extractor("indexify_extractors.pdfextractor.pdf_extractor:PDFExtractor")
   content = Content.from_file("/path/to/file.pdf")

   results =  extractor.extract(content)
   print(results)
   ```


## Continuous PDF Extraction for Applications

We've made it incredibly easy to integrate Indexify into your workflow. Get ready to supercharge your document processing capabilities!

1. Start the Indexify Server:
   ```bash
   curl https://getindexify.ai | sh
   ./indexify server -d
   ```

2. Start a long-running PDF Extractor:
   ```bash
   indexify-extractor download tensorlake/pdfextractor
   indexify-extractor join-server
   ```

3. Create an Extraction Graph:
   ```python
   from indexify import IndexifyClient, ExtractionGraph
   client = IndexifyClient()

   extraction_graph_spec = """
   name: 'pdfknowledgebase'
   extraction_policies:
      - extractor: 'tensorlake/pdfextractor'
        name: 'my-pdfextractor'
   """

   extraction_graph = ExtractionGraph.from_yaml(extraction_graph_spec)
   client.create_extraction_graph(extraction_graph)
   ```

4. Upload PDFs from your application:
   ```python
   content_id = client.upload_file("pdfknowledgebase", "/path/to/pdf.file")
   ```

5. Inspect the extracted content:
   ```python
   extracted_content = client.get_extracted_content(content_id=content_id)
   print(extracted_content)
   ```

With just a few lines of code, you can use data locked in PDFs in your applications. Example use-cases: automated data entry, intelligent document search, and effortless question answering.
