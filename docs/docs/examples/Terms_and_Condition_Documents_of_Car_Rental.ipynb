Matters not provided for in this Agreement shall be governed by relevant laws and regulations, and common practice. \\n2. \\nThe Company may make special provisions as long as they do not violate the purport of this Agreement, laws and regulations, administrative issuances, and common practice. If a special provision is made, such provision shall take precedence over this Agreement. \\n3. \\nIf the Renter has designated another Driver as described in Article 7, Paragraph 1, then the Renter shall ensure that the other Driver understands and complies with the provisions of this Agreement that concern the Driver. \\n\\n## Chapter 2 - Reservations Article 2: Making A Reservation\\n\\n1. \\nHaving consented to this Agreement, the separately prescribed price list, and other terms and conditions, the Renter may make a reservation, in accordance with the method separately provided by the Company, clearly specifying in advance the model or vehicle class, rental start date and time, rental location, rental period, return location, the name of the driver, requests for accessories such as toddler seats, and any other rental conditions (hereinafter referred to as \"Rental Conditions\"). \\n2. \\nWhen the Renter has made a reservation, the Company shall offer the Rental Cars for rent in its possession.
