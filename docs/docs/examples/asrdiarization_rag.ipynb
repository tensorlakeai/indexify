    "This notebook demonstrates a powerful pipeline for transcribing audio, such as podcasts, and performing question answering using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The pipeline combines Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), diarization, and speculative decoding techniques to efficiently process audio data and generate informative responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ASR**: We employ a state-of-the-art ASR model to convert audio into text transcriptions. The ASR pipeline is modularized, allowing flexibility in use cases where diarization may not be required.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Diarization**: Built on top of the ASR outputs, our diarization pipeline utilizes the Pyannote model, currently a leading open-source implementation. Diarization enables speaker identification and separation within the transcribed audio.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Speculative Decoding**: To accelerate inference, we incorporate speculative decoding. This technique uses a smaller, faster assistant model to propose generations that are then validated by the larger main model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: By leveraging the transcribed and diarized audio, we apply RAG to perform question answering. RAG combines information retrieval techniques with generation models to produce accurate and contextually relevant responses."
