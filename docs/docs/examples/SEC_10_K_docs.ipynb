        "This notebook demonstrates how Indexify can make it easier to quickly extract insights from complex SEC filings like the Form 10-K annual report. Using Uber's 10-K as an example, we show how the Indexify library can enable question answering on the filing text to get rapid answers. We also illustrate how schema-based extraction can pull key data points from the unstructured document. The combination of question answering and schema-based extraction provides a powerful toolkit to derive insights from dense financial filings."
