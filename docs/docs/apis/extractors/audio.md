# Audio Extractors

Extracting data from audio another important use case. Audio data is more complex than text because of the medium and nature of the information. Indexify allows you to choose between different extractors based on your use case and source of data. If you want to learn more about extractors, their design and usage, read the Indexify [documentation](https://docs.getindexify.ai/concepts/).

| Extractor Name | Use Case | Supported Input Types |
|----------------|----------|------------------------|
| ASR Diarization | Speech recognition and speaker diarization | `audio`, `audio/mpeg` |
| Whisper | Audio transcription | `audio`, `audio/mpeg` |
| Speaker Diarization | Speaker identification in transcriptions | `audio`, `audio/mpeg` |
| WhisperGroq | Whisper ASR using GROQ | `audio`, `audio/mpe`g |
| Whisper MLX | Whisper ASR on Apple MLX | `audio`, `audio/mpeg` |

## [ASR Diarization](https://github.com/tensorlakeai/indexify-extractors/tree/main/audio/asrdiarization) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/GPU%20Accelerated-green?logo=nvidia&logoColor=ffffff)

### Description
The ASR and diarization pipelines are modularly implemented, with diarization built on ASR outputs. Pyannote is recommended for state-of-the-art diarization. Speculative decoding is added to speed up inference, using a smaller model to suggest generations validated by the larger model. Note that this requires matching decoder architectures and a batch size of 1. For Whisper, a distilled version is suggested as the assistant model.
