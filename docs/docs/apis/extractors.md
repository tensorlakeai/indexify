# Extractors

Extractors are used for structured extraction from un-structured data of any modality. For example, line items of an invoice as JSON, objects in a video, embedding of text in a PDF, etc. 

## Extractor Input and Ouput 

Extractors consume `Content` which contains raw bytes of unstructured data, and they produce a list of Content and features from them. 

For example, a PDF document could be broken down to - images, multiple text chunks, tabular data encoded as JSON, embeddings of the text chunks, each would be encoded as a Content and emitted by the extractor. Indexify stores raw bytes into blob store and features such as embeddings or JSON documents into indexes for retreival. 

![High Level Concept](../images/Content_AI_Content.png)

Extractors are typically built using AI model and some additional pre and post processing of content.

## Install the SDK 
The tools to build, test and package extractors are available through the Python package `indexify_extractor_sdk`. A typescript SDK is under development also. 

```shell
pip install indexify_extractor_sdk
```

## Running Extractors

### Running extractor locally
```shell
indexify-extractor local  <extractor_file:ClassNameOfExtractor> --text "hello world"
```
This will invoke the extractor in `extractor_file.py` and create a `Content` with *hello world* as the data.

If you want to pass in the contents of a file into the payload use `--file </path/to/file>`

### Running the extractor to continuously extract ingested content
You can run the extractor as a long running process to continuosly receive stream of content and extract them from the Indexify control plane. You can run as many instances of the extractors you want and achieve scalability.
```shell
indexify-extractor join-server <extractor_module:ClassNameofExtractor> --coordinator-addr localhost:8950 --ingestion-addr localhost:8900
```
The addresses here can be found from Indexify server's configuration.

### From Packaged Containers

Extractors can be deployed in production with ease using docker along with Indexify server in a cluster. You can test an extractor packaged with docker by running docker locally.
```shell
docker run indexify-extractor local --text "hello world"
```

Passing a local file from your laptop to docker requires bind-mounting the file into the container 
```shell
docker run -v /path/to/local/file:/tmp/file run indexify-extractor local --text "hello world"
```
The name of the extractor module is retreived from an environment variable of the container `INDEXIFY_EXTRACTOR`
