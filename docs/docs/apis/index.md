# Indexify APIs

Indexify has REST APIs and a python library for adding documents and long term memory for retrieval.

Adding documents and retrieving information from them is done through the namespace API, while the memory APIs allow adding conversation memory and retrieving them.

## API Docs UI
Indexify uses Swagger to expose an interactive UI to play with the HTTP APIs, it could be a good way to experiment with the API.
The UI is available at `http://localhost:8900/api-docs-ui/`
