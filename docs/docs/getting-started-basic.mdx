## Building a Wikipedia Information Retrieval System
![Getting Started Cover Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bce022db-3586-4cac-81ba-eb4426cdd90c)

In this guide, we'll walk you through creating an online ingestion pipeline for Wikipedia pages. This pipeline will demonstrate how to:

1. Extract structured information (Named Entity Recognition) from web pages using Large Language Models (LLMs)
2. Break down (chunk) the text, create embeddings, and store them in a vector database (LanceDB in this example)

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to:

1. Use advanced LLMs like Mistral or Multimodal GPT-4 via API calls and Llama 3.1 or Phi-3 locally via Llama.CPP to answer questions based on indexed information (Retrieval-Augmented Generation or RAG)
2. Retrieve the Named Entities extracted from the text
3. Use a User Interface to visually debug your pipelines and inspect how pages are broken down into chunks

<Info>
**Supported OS**:  
Mac OS(M series).  
Linux: Ubuntu 20.04 and above, Red Hat 9 and above.  
Windows: Use WSL, but we don't actively test.
</Info>

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have:

1. Python 3.9 or higher installed
2. Basic knowledge of Python programming
3. Familiarity with command-line interfaces
4. An OpenAI API key (only if using GPT models)

## Setup

You'll need three separate terminal windows open for this tutorial:

1. Terminal 1: For downloading and running the Indexify Server
2. Terminal 2: For running Indexify extractors (handling structured extraction, chunking, and embedding)
3. Terminal 3: For running Python scripts to load and query data from the Indexify server

We'll use the following notation to indicate which terminal to use:

```bash Terminal X Description of Command

```

![Indexify Terminal](https://github.com/tensorlakeai/indexify-extractors/assets/44690292/c0185f07-5033-4e7c-9040-7854b996d430)

### Understanding Indexify Components

Here are components which you will touch while working through the example:

1. **Indexify Server**: The central coordinator and data ingestion API.
2. **Extractors**: Specialized workers designed to perform specific data processing tasks (e.g., embedding data, generating summaries, or extracting features from unstructured data).
3. **Extraction Graph**: A declarative YAML file that chains together extractors into a complex pipeline.

The directory structure of our project, will look like this 

```text Directory Structure
indexify-tutorial
│
├── venv                   # Virtual environment (created by python3 -m venv venv)
│
├── graph.yaml             # Extraction graph definition
├── setup.py               # Script to create the extraction graph
├── ingest.py              # Script to ingest Wikipedia data
├── query.py               # Script to query the indexed data
│
└── indexify               # Indexify server executable (downloaded by curl command)
```

## Step 1: Setting Up the Indexify Server

Let's start by downloading and running the Indexify server:

```bash Terminal 1 - Download Indexify Server
curl https://getindexify.ai | sh
./indexify server -d
```

This command creates two important endpoints:

1. Ingestion API: `http://localhost:8900`
2. User Interface: `http://localhost:8900/ui`

The Ingestion API is used for uploading content and retrieving data from indexes and SQL tables, while the User Interface provides a dashboard for visualizing extraction graphs, content, and indexes.

## Step 2: Creating a Virtual Environment

It's good practice to use a virtual environment for Python projects. Let's create one and install the necessary packages:

```bash Terminal 2 - Install Dependencies
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install indexify-extractor-sdk indexify wikipedia openai llama-cpp-python mistralai langchain_community
```

## Step 3: Setting Up Indexify Extractors

The next step is to set up the extractors, which are essential for structured extraction from unstructured data across different modalities. For instance, in this example we use different extractors for parsing HTML and converting into text, chunking the text, and embedding it.

Extractors consume Content, which consists of raw bytes of unstructured data, and then produce a list of processed Content along with extracted features.

![Extractor Working](/images/Extractor_Transformation_Concept.png)

If you want to read and understand how to build a custom extractor for your own use case, go through the following section. However, if you want to use a built-in available extractor jump to the [next section](#using-available-extractors). 

### Using Custom Extractors

Custom Extractors are written by implementing a Python class that extends the `Extractor` abstractor class from the `indexify-extractor-sdk` package.

Here is an example Extrator, which does Named Entity Recognition on text data.

```python
class NerExtract(Extractor):
    name = 'yourorg/nerextractor'
    
    def extract(self, content: Content) -> List[Content]:
        """
        Extracts named entities from content.
        """
        output = []
        chunks = chunk_content(content)
        for chunk in chunks:
            entities = run_ner_model(chunk)
            metadata_chunk = Content(content_type='application/json', data=entities),
            output.append([metadata_chunk])
        return output
```

An extractor receives data in a `Content` object and transforms it into one or more `Content` objects, optionally adding `Embedding` objects during extraction. For example, you could split a PDF into multiple content pieces, each with its text and corresponding embedding or named entities detected in the text.

Indexify provides tools to test extractors locally, package and deploy them to production. For detailed instructions, [please see this page](develop_extractors).

### Using Available Extractors

As mentioned before, for the purpose of this tutorial, we already have Extractors written, deployed and tested.

Now, let's download three essential extractors:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Terminal 2 - Download Indexify Extractors for Llama.CPP
source venv/bin/activate
indexify-extractor download tensorlake/llama_cpp
indexify-extractor download tensorlake/minilm-l6
indexify-extractor download tensorlake/chunk-extractor
indexify-extractor join-server
```
```bash Terminal 2 - Download Indexify Extractors for OpenAI
source venv/bin/activate
export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
indexify-extractor download tensorlake/openai
indexify-extractor download tensorlake/minilm-l6
indexify-extractor download tensorlake/chunk-extractor
indexify-extractor join-server
```
```bash Terminal 2 - Download Indexify Extractors for Mistral
source venv/bin/activate
export MISTRAL_API_KEY="YOUR_MISTRAL_API_KEY"
indexify-extractor download tensorlake/mistral
indexify-extractor download tensorlake/minilm-l6
indexify-extractor download tensorlake/chunk-extractor
indexify-extractor join-server
```
</CodeGroup>

Now, let's start all available extractors:

```bash Terminal 2 - Starting Extractor Workers
indexify-extractor join-server
```

## Step 4: Defining Our Data Pipeline

We'll define our data pipeline using a YAML file to process text documents by splitting them into chunks, extracting entities, and embedding the chunks in parallel. The following diagram outlines the Indexify end-to-end pipeline.

![Extraction Policy Graph](/images/extraction_graph_getting_started.png)

Let us create (or open) a file named `graph.yaml` with the following content:

<CodeGroup>
```yaml graph.yaml for Llama.CPP
name: "wiki_extraction_pipeline"
extraction_policies:
  - extractor: "tensorlake/llama_cpp"
    name: "entity-extractor" 
    input_params:
      system_prompt: "Extract entities from text, and return the output in JSON format."
  - extractor: "tensorlake/chunk-extractor"
    name: "chunker"
    input_params:
      chunk_size: 1000
      overlap: 100
  - extractor: "tensorlake/minilm-l6"
    name: "wikiembedding"
    content_source: "chunker"
```
```yaml graph.yaml for OpenAI
name: "wiki_extraction_pipeline"
extraction_policies:
  - extractor: "tensorlake/openai"
    name: "entity-extractor" 
    input_params:
      model: "gpt-4o-mini"
      system_prompt: "Extract entities from text, and return the output in JSON format."
  - extractor: "tensorlake/chunk-extractor"
    name: "chunker"
    input_params:
      chunk_size: 1000
      overlap: 100
  - extractor: "tensorlake/minilm-l6"
    name: "wikiembedding"
    content_source: "chunker"
```
```yaml graph.yaml for Mistral
name: "wiki_extraction_pipeline"
extraction_policies:
  - extractor: "tensorlake/mistral"
    name: "entity-extractor" 
    input_params:
      system_prompt: "Extract entities from text, and return the output in JSON format."
  - extractor: "tensorlake/chunk-extractor"
    name: "chunker"
    input_params:
      chunk_size: 1000
      overlap: 100
  - extractor: "tensorlake/minilm-l6"
    name: "wikiembedding"
    content_source: "chunker"
```
</CodeGroup>

This YAML file defines three extraction policies:

1. `entity-extractor`: Extracts named entities from the text
2. `chunker`: Splits the text into smaller chunks
3. `wikiembedding`: Creates embeddings for the chunks

These are the three key extractors are utilized to process and analyze the input content from Wikipedia:

1. Llama CPP Extractor(`tensorlake/llama_cpp`): Uses Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct model for entity extraction from text input type. OR OpenAI Extractor(`tensorlake/openai`): Uses OpenAI’s LLMs for entity extraction from various input types (text, PDF, images). OR Mistral Extractor(`tensorlake/mistral`): Uses Mistral AI API for entity extraction from text input type. All these can be customized with specific system prompts to tailor its output.

2. Chunk Extractor(`tensorlake/chunk-extractor`): Breaks down text into chunks, offering flexibility in chunk size and overlap.

3. MiniLM-L6 Extractor(`tensorlake/minilm-l6`): Generates embeddings of the text chunks for semantic search and retrieval.

These extractors work in concert to transform raw, unstructured input into processed, indexed, and easily retrievable information, forming the backbone of the Indexify pipeline for tasks such as entity recognition, text segmentation, and semantic embedding. You can learn more about different types of available extractors and their usage [here](https://docs.getindexify.ai/apis/extractors/).

## Step 5: Creating the Extraction Graph

Now, let's create a Python script to set up our extraction graph using the YAML file we just created.

Create a file named `setup.py` with the following content:

```python setup.py
from indexify import IndexifyClient, ExtractionGraph

client = IndexifyClient()

def create_extraction_graph():
    extraction_graph = ExtractionGraph.from_yaml_file("graph.yaml")
    client.create_extraction_graph(extraction_graph)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    create_extraction_graph()
```

Run this script to create the extraction graph:

```bash Terminal 3 - Create Extraction Graph
source venv/bin/activate
python3 ./setup.py
```

## Step 6: Loading Data

Now that we have our extraction graph set up, let's create (or open) a script to load the Wikipedia data into our pipeline.

Create a file named `ingest.py` with the following content:

```python ingest.py
from indexify import IndexifyClient, ExtractionGraph
from langchain_community.document_loaders import WikipediaLoader

client = IndexifyClient()

def load_data(player):
    docs = WikipediaLoader(query=player, load_max_docs=1).load()

    for doc in docs:
        client.add_documents("wiki_extraction_pipeline", doc.page_content)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    load_data("Kevin Durant")
    load_data("Stephen Curry")
```

Run this script to ingest data into Indexify:

```bash Terminal 3 - Ingest Data
source venv/bin/activate
python3 ./ingest.py
```

## Step 7: Querying Indexify

Now that we have data in our system, let's create a script to query Indexify and retrieve information.

You can query Indexify to - 

1. List ingested content by extraction graph. You can also list content per extraction policy.
2. Get extracted data from any of the extraction policies of an Extraction Graph.
3. Perform semantic search on vector indexes populated by embedding extractors.
4. Run SQL Queries on structured data(not in this tutorial).

<CodeGroup>
```bash Terminal 3 - Run our RAG query for Llama.CPP
python3 ./query.py
```
```bash Terminal 3 - Run our RAG query for OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
python3 ./query.py
```
```bash Terminal 3 - Run our RAG query for Mistral
export MISTRAL_API_KEY="YOUR_MISTRAL_API_KEY"
python3 ./query.py
```
</CodeGroup>

For now let us create a file named `query.py` with the following content:

<CodeGroup>
```python query.py for Llama.CPP
from indexify import IndexifyClient
from llama_cpp import Llama

client = IndexifyClient()
llm = Llama.from_pretrained(repo_id='microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-gguf', filename='*q4.gguf', verbose=False)

# Get entities
ingested_content_list = client.list_content("wiki_extraction_pipeline")
content_id = ingested_content_list[0].id
entities = client.get_extracted_content(
    content_id, 
    "wiki_extraction_pipeline", 
    "entity-extractor")

# Get chunks
chunks = client.get_extracted_content(
    content_id, 
    "wiki_extraction_pipeline", 
    "chunker")

def query_database(question: str, index: str, top_k=3):
    retrieved_results = client.search_index(name=index, query=question, top_k=top_k)
    context = "\n-".join([item["text"] for item in retrieved_results])
    
    response = llm.create_chat_completion(
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that answers questions based on the given context."},
            {"role": "user", "content": f"Answer the following question based on the context provided:\nQuestion: {question}\nContext: {context}"}
        ]
    )
    
    return response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    index_name = "wiki_extraction_pipeline.wikiembedding.embedding"
    indexes = client.indexes()
    print(f"Vector indexes present: {indexes}, querying index: {index_name}")
    print(
        query_database(
            "What accomplishments did Kevin durant achieve during his career?",
            "wiki_extraction_pipeline.wikiembedding.embedding",
            4,
        )
    )
```
```python query.py for OpenAI
from indexify import IndexifyClient
from openai import OpenAI

client = IndexifyClient()
client_openai = OpenAI(api_key="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY")

# Get entities
ingested_content_list = client.list_content("wiki_extraction_pipeline")
content_id = ingested_content_list[0].id
entities = client.get_extracted_content(
    content_id, 
    "wiki_extraction_pipeline", 
    "entity-extractor")

# Get chunks
chunks = client.get_extracted_content(
    content_id, 
    "wiki_extraction_pipeline", 
    "chunker")

def query_database(question: str, index: str, top_k=3):
    retrieved_results = client.search_index(name=index, query=question, top_k=top_k)
    context = "\n-".join([item["text"] for item in retrieved_results])
    
    response = client_openai.chat.completions.create(
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that answers questions based on the given context."},
            {"role": "user", "content": f"Answer the following question based on the context provided:\nQuestion: {question}\nContext: {context}"}
        ],
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
    )
    
    return response.choices[0].message.content

if __name__ == "__main__":
    index_name = "wiki_extraction_pipeline.wikiembedding.embedding"
    indexes = client.indexes()
    print(f"Vector indexes present: {indexes}, querying index: {index_name}")
    print(
        query_database(
            "What accomplishments did Kevin durant achieve during his career?",
            "wiki_extraction_pipeline.wikiembedding.embedding",
            4,
        )
    )
```
```python query.py for Mistral
from indexify import IndexifyClient
from mistralai.client import MistralClient
from mistralai.models.chat_completion import ChatMessage

client = IndexifyClient()
client_mistral = MistralClient(api_key="YOUR_MISTRAL_API_KEY")

# Get entities
ingested_content_list = client.list_content("wiki_extraction_pipeline")
content_id = ingested_content_list[0].id
entities = client.get_extracted_content(
    content_id, 
    "wiki_extraction_pipeline", 
    "entity-extractor")

# Get chunks
chunks = client.get_extracted_content(
    content_id, 
    "wiki_extraction_pipeline", 
    "chunker")

def query_database(question: str, index: str, top_k=3):
    retrieved_results = client.search_index(name=index, query=question, top_k=top_k)
    context = "\n-".join([item["text"] for item in retrieved_results])
    
    response = client_mistral.chat(
        messages=[ChatMessage(role="system", content="You are a helpful assistant that answers questions based on the given context."),
                  ChatMessage(role="user", content=f"Answer the following question based on the context provided:\nQuestion: {question}\nContext: {context}")],
        model="mistral-large-latest",
    )
    
    return response.choices[0].message.content

if __name__ == "__main__":
    index_name = "wiki_extraction_pipeline.wikiembedding.embedding"
    indexes = client.indexes()
    print(f"Vector indexes present: {indexes}, querying index: {index_name}")
    print(
        query_database(
            "What accomplishments did Kevin durant achieve during his career?",
            "wiki_extraction_pipeline.wikiembedding.embedding",
            4,
        )
    )
```
</CodeGroup>

Run this script to query the indexed data:

You should see a response summarizing Kevin Durant's career accomplishments based on the indexed Wikipedia data.

```text Output
Kevin Durant has achieved numerous accomplishments during his career, including:

1. NBA Championships: Won two NBA titles with the Golden State Warriors in 2017 and 2018.
2. NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP): Won the regular season MVP award in 2014.
3. NBA Finals MVP: Named Finals MVP in both 2017 and 2018.
4. All-Star selections: Selected to the NBA All-Star team multiple times (exact number may vary depending on the most recent data).
5. All-NBA Team selections: Named to multiple All-NBA Teams, including First Team selections.
6. Scoring titles: Led the league in scoring multiple times.
7. Olympic gold medals: Won gold medals with Team USA in basketball.
8. Rookie of the Year: Won the NBA Rookie of the Year award in 2008.

These accomplishments highlight Durant's status as one of the premier players in the NBA, showcasing his scoring ability, leadership, and overall impact on the game.
```
