### [OpenAI Clip](https://github.com/tensorlakeai/indexify-extractors/tree/main/embedding/clip_embedding)
This extractor utilizes OpenAI's CLIP model to generate embeddings for both images and text.

### [Arctic - Sentence Transformer](https://github.com/tensorlakeai/indexify-extractors/tree/main/embedding/arctic)
This extractor extractors an embedding for a piece of text.
It uses the huggingface [Snowflake's Arctic-embed-m](https://huggingface.co/Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-m). The snowflake-arctic-embedding models achieve state-of-the-art performance on the MTEB/BEIR leaderboard for each of their size variants.

### [MiniLML6 - Sentence Transformer](https://github.com/tensorlakeai/indexify-extractors/tree/main/embedding/minilm-l6)
This extractor extractors an embedding for a piece of text.
It uses the huggingface [MiniLM-6 model](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2), which is a tiny but very robust embedding model for text.

### [MPnet - Sentence Transformer](https://github.com/tensorlakeai/indexify-extractors/tree/main/embedding/mpnet)
This is a sentence embedding extractor based on the [MPNET Multilingual Base V2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2).
This is a sentence-transformers model: It maps sentences & paragraphs to a 768 dimensional dense vector space and can be used for tasks like clustering or semantic search.
It's best use case is paraphrasing, but it can also be used for other tasks.

### [OpenAI Embedding](https://github.com/tensorlakeai/indexify-extractors/tree/main/embedding/openai-embedding)
This extractor extracts an embedding for a piece of text.
It uses the OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 model.
