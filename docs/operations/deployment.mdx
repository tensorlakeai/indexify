Indexify can be deployed in the following ways -
* Bare Metal and VMs
* Docker Compose
* Kubernetes (or any other container orchestrator)

## Bare Metal

Indexify doesn't depend on Kubernetes or Docker, you can run the server and executors on any VM or
bare metal machines.

#### Start Server
Start the server on one machine. Read the configuration reference to understand how to customize the server to use blob stores for storing function outputs.
```bash
indexify-server
```
<Note>
We have a replicated mode for the server, based on Raft consensus protocol. It's not public yet because
we are still figuring out how to make it easy to configure, operate and use by developers.
If you are interested in using it, please reach out to us.
</Note>

#### Start Executor
Start as many executors you want in different machines.
```bash
indexify-cli executor --server-addr <server-ip>:<server-port>
```


## Docker Compose
You can spin up the server and executor using docker compose, and deploy and run in a production-like environment. Copy the [docker-compose.yaml file from here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tensorlakeai/indexify/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.yaml).

```bash
docker compose up
```

This starts the server and two replicas of the exeuctor in separate containers.
Change the `replicas` field for the executor in docker compose to add more executors (i.e parallelism) to the workflow.

This uses a default executor container based on Debian and a vanilla Python installation.
We generally provide docker compose files for local testing of every example project in the repository.

## Kubernetes

We provide some basic Helm charts to deploy Indexify on Kubernetes.
If you'd like to try with your own cluster, check out the
