## Create and Deploy Durable, Data-Intensive Agentic Workflows

*Indexify simplifies building and serving durable, multi-stage workflows as inter-connected Python functions and automagically deploys them as APIs.*

A **workflow** encodes data ingestion and transformation stages that can be implemented using Python functions. Each of these functions is a logical compute unit that can be retried upon failure or assigned to specific hardware.

All three functions of the workflow are running in parallel and coordinated by the Indexify server.*

### üí° Use Cases

**Indexify** is a versatile data processing framework for all kinds of use cases, including:

* [Scraping and Summarizing Websites](examples/website_audio_summary/)
* [Extracting and Indexing PDF Documents](examples/pdf_document_extraction/)
* [Transcribing and Summarizing Audio Files](examples/video_summarization/)
* [Object Detection and Description](examples/object_detection/)
* [Knowledge Graph RAG and Question Answering](examples/knowledge_graph/)

### ‚≠ê Key Features

* **Dynamic Routing:** Route data to different specialized models based on conditional branching logic.
* **Local Inference:** Execute LLMs directly within workflow functions using LLamaCPP, vLLM, or Hugging Face Transformers.
* **Distributed Processing:** Run functions in parallel across machines so that results across functions can be combined as they complete.
* **Workflow Versioning:** Version compute graphs to update previously processed data to reflect the latest functions and models.
* **Resource Allocation:** Span workflows across GPU and CPU instances so that functions can be assigned to their optimal hardware.
* **Request Optimization:** Maximize GPU utilization by automatically queuing and batching invocations in parallel.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Install Indexify's SDK and CLI into your development environment:

```bash
pip install indexify
```

## üìö A Minimal Example

Define a workflow by implementing its data transformation as composable Python functions. Functions decorated with `@indexify_function()`. These functions form the edges of a `Graph`, which is the representation of a compute graph. <br></br>
Functions serve as discrete units within a Graph, defining the boundaries for retry attempts and resource allocation. They separate computationally heavy tasks like LLM inference from lightweight ones like database writes. <br></br>
The example below is a pipeline that calculates the sum of squares for the first consecutive whole numbers. 

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from indexify import indexify_function, indexify_router, Graph
from typing import List, Union

class Document(BaseModel):
   pages: List[str]

# Parse a pdf and extract text
@indexify_function()
def process_document(file: File) -> Document:
    # Process a PDF and extract pages

class TextChunk(BaseModel):
   chunk: str
   page_number: int

# Chunk the pages for embedding and retreival
@indexify_function()
def chunk_document(document: Document) -> List[TextChunk]:
    # Split the pages

# Embed a single chunk.
# Note: (Automatic Map) Indexify automatically parallelize functions when they consume an element
# from functions that produces a List
@indexify_functions()
def embed_and_write(chunk: TextChunk) -> ChunkEmbedding:
    # run an embedding model on the chunk
    # write_to_db

# Constructs a compute graph connecting the three functions defined above into a workflow that generates
# runs them as a pipeline
graph = Graph(name="document_ingestion_pipeline", start_node=process_document, description="...")
graph.add_edge(process_document, chunk_document)
graph.add_edge(chunk_document, embed_and_write)
```

### üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

#### ‚è≥ Scheduler

* **Function Batching:** Process multiple functions in a single batch to improve efficiency.
* **Data Localized Execution:** Boost performance by prioritizing execution on machines where intermediate outputs exist already.
* **Reducer Optimizations:** Optimize performance by batching the serial execution of reduced function calls.
* **Parallel Scheduling:** Reduce latency by enabling parallel execution across multiple machines.
* **Cyclic Graph Support:** Enable more flexible agentic behaviors by leveraging cycles in graphs.
* **Ephemeral Graphs:** Perform multi-stage inference and retrieval without persisting intermediate outputs.
* **Data Loader Functions:** Stream values into graphs over time using the `yield` keyword.

#### üõ†Ô∏è SDK

* **TypeScript SDK:** Build an SDK for writing workflows in Typescript.
