    "# PDF Translation with Indexify and OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo\n",
    "\n",
    "This cookbook demonstrates how to build a robust PDF translation pipeline from English to French using Indexify and OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model. You will learn how to efficiently translate PDF documents for various applications such as localization, multilingual content creation, and cross-language information retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "PDF translation involves extracting text from PDF files and then translating that text from one language to another. By applying this technique, we can automatically generate translated versions of PDF documents, making information more accessible across language barriers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin, ensure you have the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a virtual env with Python 3.9 or later\n",
    "  ```shell\n",
    "  python3.9 -m venv ve\n",
    "  source ve/bin/activate\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- `pip` (Python package manager)\n",
    "- An OpenAI API key\n",
    "- Basic familiarity with Python and command-line interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install Indexify\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's install Indexify using the official installation script in a terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl https://getindexify.ai | sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Start the Indexify server:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "./indexify server -d\n",
    "```\n",
    "This starts a long running server that exposes ingestion and retrieval APIs to applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install Required Extractors\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll install the necessary extractors in a new terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install indexify-extractor-sdk\n",
    "indexify-extractor download tensorlake/pdfextractor\n",
    "indexify-extractor download tensorlake/openai\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the extractors are downloaded, you can start them:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "indexify-extractor join-server\n",
    "```"

    "## Customization and Advanced Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "You can customize the translation process by modifying the `system_prompt` in the extraction graph. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To focus on a specific domain or style:\n",
    "  ```yaml\n",
    "  system_prompt: 'You are a professional translator specializing in scientific literature. Translate the following English text to French, maintaining academic tone and terminology.'\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- To handle multiple languages:\n",
    "  ```yaml\n",
    "  system_prompt: 'You are a multilingual translator. Translate the following text from English to [TARGET_LANGUAGE]. Maintain the original formatting and structure as much as possible.'\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also experiment with different OpenAI models by changing the `model_name` parameter to find the best balance between speed, accuracy, and cost for your specific use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This PDF translation pipeline demonstrates the power and flexibility of Indexify:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scalability**: Indexify can handle large volumes of PDFs, processing them efficiently and with automatic retries if any step fails.\n",
    "2. **Flexibility**: You can easily swap out the PDF extractor or translation model to suit your specific needs.\n",
    "3. **Integration**: This pipeline can be seamlessly integrated into larger workflows or applications for automated document translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explore more Indexify features in the [official documentation](https://docs.getindexify.ai)\n",
    "- Experiment with different language pairs and domain-specific translations\n",
    "- Integrate this translation pipeline into your own applications or workflows"
