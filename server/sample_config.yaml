# Executor catalog configuration.
#
# Each catalog entry defines a named executor type and the regions where
# it can be deployed. This creates a structured catalog of available
# executor configurations.
#
# Executors connect with labels including "sku" and "region" that must
# match an entry in this catalog to be accepted.
#
# If no catalog entries are configured, executor label checks are not
# enforced; all executor labels are allowed.
